[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/actions)

A framework for data management in Kubernetes.  It allows domain experts to
define application-specific data management workflows through Kubernetes API
extensions. Kanister makes it easy to integrate your application's data with
your storage infrastructure.

## Features

- **Tasks Execute Anywhere:** Exec into running containers or spin up new ones.
- **Object Storage:** Efficiently and securely transfer data between your app and
  Object Storage  using Restic.
- **Block Storage:** Backup, restore, and copy data using your storage's APIs.
- **Kubernetes Workload Integration:** Easily perform common workload operations
  like scaling up/down, acting on all mounted PVCs and many more.
- **Application Centric:** A single Blueprint handles workflows for every
  instance of your app.
- **Kubernetes Native APIs:** APIs built using CRDs that play nicely with the
  Kubernetes ecosystem.
- **Secured by RBAC:** Prevent unauthorized access to your workflows using RBAC.
- **Reporting:** Watching, logging and eventing let you know the impact of your
  workflows.
