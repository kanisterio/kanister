Kanister is a data protection workflow management tool. It provides a set of
cohesive APIs for defining and curating data operations by abstracting away
tedious details around executing data operations on Kubernetes. It's extensible
and easy to install, operate and scale.

## Highlights

âœ… _Kubernetes centric_ - Kanister's APIs are implemented as [Custom Resource
Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/)
that conforms to Kubernetes' declarative management, security and distribution
models.

âœ… _Storage agnostic_ - Kanister allows you to efficiently and securely transfer
backup data between your services and the object storage service of your choice.
Use Kanister to backup, restore, and copy your data using your storage's APIs,
and Kanister won't get in the way.

âœ… _Asynchronous or synchronous task execution_ - Kanister can schedule your data
operation to run asynchronously in dedicated job pods, or synchronously via
Kubernetes apimachinery `ExecStream` framework.

âœ… _Re-usable workflow artifacts_ -  A Kanister blueprint can be re-used across
multiple workflows to protect different environment deployments.

âœ… _Extensible, atomic data operation functions_ - Kanister provides a collection
of easy-to-use
[data operation functions](https://docs.kanister.io/functions.html) that you can
add to your blueprint to express detailed backup and restore operation steps,
including pre-backup scaling down of replicas, working with all mounted volumes
in a pod etc.

âœ… _Secured via RBAC_ - Prevent unauthorized access to your workflows via Kubernetes
[role-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
model.

âœ… _Observability_ - Kanister exposes logs, events and metrics to popular
observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Loki to provide you with
operational insights into your data protection workflows.

## Quickstart

Follow the instructions in
[the installation documentation](https://docs.kanister.io/install.html), to
install Kanister on your Kubernetes cluster.

Walk through the [tutorial](https://docs.kanister.io/tutorial.html) to define,
curate and run your first data protection workflow using Kanister blueprints,
actionsets and profiles.

The [`examples`](./examples) directory contains many sample blueprints that you
can use to define data operations for:

- [AWS RDS](./examples/aws-rds)
- [Cassandra](./examples/cassandra)
- [Couchbase](./examples/couchbase)
- [Elasticsearch](./examples/elasticsearch)
- [etcd](./examples/etcd/etcd-in-cluster)
- [FoundationDB](./examples/foundationdb)
- [K8ssandra](./examples/k8ssandra)
- [MongoDB](./examples/mongodb)
- [MongoDB on OpenShift using DeploymentConfig](./examples/mongodb-deploymentconfig)
- [MySQL](./examples/mysql)
- [MySQL on OpenShift using DeploymentConfig](./examples/mysql-deploymentconfig)
- [PostgreSQL](./examples/postgresql)
- [PostgreSQL on OpenShift using DeploymentConfig](./examples/postgresql-deploymentconfig)
- [Redis](./examples/redis)

The Kanister architecture is documented
[here](https://docs.kanister.io/architecture.html).
