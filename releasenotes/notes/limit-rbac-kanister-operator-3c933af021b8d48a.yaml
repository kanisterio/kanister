upgrade:
  - Users upgrading from previous versions should note that the ``edit`` ``ClusterRoleBinding`` is no longer included by default. They must now create their own ``Role`` / ``RoleBinding`` with appropriate permissions for Kanister's Service Account in the application's namespace.
security:
  - Enhanced security by removing the default ``edit`` ``ClusterRoleBinding`` assignment, minimizing the risk of excessive permissions.
