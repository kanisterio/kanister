upgrade:
  - Users upgrading from previous versions should note that the `edit` `ClusterRoleBinding` is no longer included by default. They must now create their own `Role` / `RoleBinding` with appropriate permissions for Kanister's Service Account in the application's namespace.
security:
  - Enhanced security by removing the default `edit` `ClusterRoleBinding` assignment, minimizing the risk of excessive permissions.
