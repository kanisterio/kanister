# Examples

This folder contains some Helm charts that have been updated to include Kanister
blueprints, to make experimenting with Kanister easier.

If you are new to Kanister, start with the `time-log` blueprint. After that,
feel free to try out some of the more advanced examples like the blueprints for
MySQL, PgSQL, MongoDB and ElasticSearch, following the instructions in the corresponding folder.

Every example has its own README.md with information on how to set things up and
commands to be run.

Found a mistake in a blueprint? Having difficulty getting the blueprints to
work? Find us on the Kanister [Slack](kanisterio.slack.com).
