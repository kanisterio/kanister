Design Goals
============

The design of Kanister was driven by the following main goals:

1. **Application-Centric:** Given the increasingly complex and distributed nature
   of cloud-native data services, there is a growing need for data management
   tasks to be at the *application* level. Experts who possess domain knowledge
   of a specific application's needs should be able to capture these needs when
   performing data operations on that application.

2. **API Driven:** Data management tasks for each specific application may vary
   widely, and these tasks should be encapsulated by a well-defined API so as to
   provide a uniform data management experience. Each application expert can
   provide an application-specific pluggable implementation that satisfies this
   API, thus enabling a homogeneous data management experience of diverse and
   evolving data services.

3. **Extensible:** Any data management solution capable of managing a diverse set of
   applications must be flexible enough to capture the needs of custom data services
   running in a variety of environments. Such flexibility can only be provided if
   the solution itself can easily be extended.


Getting Started
===============

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`install` section to get Kanister up and
running on your Kubernetes cluster. Then see Kanister in action by going through
the walkthrough under :ref:`tutorial`.

The :ref:`architecture` section provides architectural insights into how things
work. We recommend that you take a look at it.
