Automating ActionSet Creation using Argo Cron Workflows
**********************************************************

Argo Workflows enables us to schedule operations. In the Kanister project,
Argo Cron Workflows will be used to automate the creation of ActionSets to
execute Blueprint actions at regular intervals.

To summarize, ActionSets are CRs that are used to execute actions
from Blueprint CRs. The Kanister controller watches for the creation
of ActionSets and executes the specified action.

In this tutorial, you will schedule the creation of a backup ActionSet using
Argo Cron Workflows.


Prerequisites
=============

* Kubernetes ``1.20`` or higher.
* A running Kanister controller in the ``Kanister`` namespace. See :ref:`install`
* ``kanctl`` CLI installed. See Tools_.


Architecture
============

Steps
=====

Step 1 - Setting up Argo
-------------------------

Download the Argo CLI from their Releases_ page.

Create a separate namespace for the Workflows.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl create ns argo

In this tutorial, the Argo Workflows CRDs and other resources will be
deployed on the Kubernetes cluster using the minimal manifest file.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/manifests/quick-start-minimal.yaml -n argo

You can install Argo in either cluster scoped or namespace scope configurations.
To deploy Argo with custom configuration, download the minimal manifest file
and apply the necessary changes.
For more information, see ManagedNamespaces_.

Use ``port-forward`` to forward a local port to the argo-server pod's port to view
the Argo UI:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl -n argo port-forward deployment/argo-server 2746:2746

Open a web browser and navigate to ``localhost:2746``

Step 2 - Setting up a sample application to backup
--------------------------------------------------

Here, you will reference the MySQL_ example from Kanister.

1. Install the chart and set up MySQL in the ``mysql-test`` namespace.
2. Integrate it with Kanister by creating a Profile CR in the ``mysql-test``
   namespace and a Blueprint in the ``kanister`` namespace.
3. Copy and save the names of the MySQL StatefulSet, secrets, Kanister Blueprint,
   and the Profile CR for the next step.


Step 3 - Creating a Cron Workflow
---------------------------------

Now, create a Cron Workflow to automate the creation of an ActionSet to backup
the MySQL application. The workflow will use ``kanctl`` to achieve this.
Modify the ``kanctl`` command in the YAML below to specify the names of the
Blueprint, Profile, MySQL StatefulSet, and secrets created in the previous step.

.. code-block:: bash

  kanctl create actionset --action backup --namespace kanister --blueprint <BLUEPRINT_NAME> --statefulset <NAMESPACE/STATEFULSET> --profile <NAMESPACE/PROFILE_NAME> --secrets <NAMESPACE/SECRETS_NAME>

Then execute:

.. code-block:: yaml

  cat <<EOF >> mysql-cron-wf.yaml
  apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: CronWorkflow
  metadata:
    name: mysql-cron-wf
  spec:
    schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
    concurrencyPolicy: "Replace"
    workflowSpec:
      entrypoint: automate-actionset
      templates:
        - name: automate-actionset
          container:
            image: ghcr.io/kanisterio/kanister-tools:0.81.0
            command:
              - /bin/bash
              - -c
              - |
                microdnf install tar
                curl -LO https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/releases/download/0.81.0/kanister_0.81.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
                tar -C /usr/local/bin -xvf kanister_0.81.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
                kanctl create actionset --action backup --namespace kanister --blueprint mysql-blueprint --statefulset mysql-test/mysql-release --profile mysql-test/s3-profile-gd4kx --secrets mysql=mysql-test/mysql-release
  EOF

.. note::
  Here, the cron job is scheduled to run every 5 minutes. This means that an
  ActionSet is created every 5 minutes to perform a backup operation.
  You may schedule it to run as per your requirements.


Step 4 - Granting RBAC permissions
----------------------------------

Next, you will grant the required permissions to the Service Account in the ``argo``
namespace to access resources in the ``kanister`` and ``mysql-test`` namespaces.
This is required to create CRs based on the Secrets and StatefulSet that you
provided in the previous step.
You may read more about RBAC authorization here - RBAC_.

1. Create a RoleBinding named ``cron-wf-manager`` in the ``kanister`` and
   ``mysql-test`` namespaces.
2. Grant the permissions in ClusterRole ``cluster-admin`` to the
   default ServiceAccount named ``default`` in the ``argo`` namespace.

Execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl create rolebinding cron-wf-manager --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=argo:default -n kanister

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl create rolebinding cron-wf-manager --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=argo:default -n mysql-test

.. note::
  It is not recommended to grant the ``cluster-admin`` privileges to the ``default``
  ServiceAccount in production. You must create a separate Role or a ClusterRole to
  grant specific access for allowing the creation of Custom Resources (ActionSets)
  in the ``kanister`` namespace.


Step 5 - Launching the Cron Workflow
----------------------------------------------------

Launch the workflow in the ``argo`` namespace by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  argo cron create mysql-cron-wf.yaml -n argo

Check if the workflow was created by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  argo cron list -n argo

When the workflow runs, check if the ActionSet was created in the ``kanister`` namespace:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get actionsets.cr.kanister.io -n kanister

The output should be similar to the sample output below.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ argo cron create mysql-cron-wf.yaml -n argo
  > Name:                   mysql-cron-wf
    Namespace:              argo
    Created:                Fri Jul 22 10:23:09 -0400 (now)
    Schedule:               */5 * * * *
    Suspended:              false
    ConcurrencyPolicy:      Replace
    NextScheduledTime:      Fri Jul 22 10:25:00 -0400 (1 minute from now) (assumes workflow-controller is in UTC)

  $ argo cron list -n argo
  > NAME            AGE    LAST RUN    NEXT RUN      SCHEDULE      TIMEZONE        SUSPENDED
    mysql-cron-wf   12s    N/A         1m            */5 * * * *                   false

  $ argo cron list -n argo
  > NAME            AGE    LAST RUN    NEXT RUN      SCHEDULE      TIMEZONE        SUSPENDED
    mysql-cron-wf   4m     2m          2m            */5 * * * *                   false

  $ kubectl get actionsets.cr.kanister.io -n kanister
  > NAME            AGE
    backup-478lk    2m28s

In the above example, the workflow was created and scheduled to run
in 1 minute. This scheduled time can be anywhere between 1 to 5 minutes for you.
Once the workflow runs successfully, the ``LAST RUN`` field is updated with the
timestamp of the last run. Along with this, a backup ActionSet must be created.
The creation time of the ActionSet is indicated by the ``AGE`` field as seen above.

You should see the workflow on the Argo UI under the Cron Workflows tab.

.. image:: img/argo-cron-created-ui-list.png

On clicking on the workflow name, you will see its status.

Troubleshooting
===============

If the Cron Workflow does not run, check if the pod to run the workflow was
created in the ``argo`` namespace. Examine the logs of this pod.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl logs <NAME_OF_MYSQL_CRON_WORKFLOW_POD> -n argo

If this pod was not created, examine the logs of the Argo Workflow Controller
in the ``argo`` namespace.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl logs <NAME_OF_WORKFLOW_CONTROLLER> -n argo

If the logs mention that you have not granted the right permissions to the
ServiceAccounts, circle back to Step 4 and verify your RBAC configuration.
Your ServiceAccount should have access to the requested resources.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get serviceaccounts -n argo


Cleanup
=======

Delete the cron workflow by running the following. Verify the name of your
workflow before deleting it.

Verify workflow name:

.. code-block:: bash

  argo cron list -n argo

Delete workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

  argo cron delete mysql-cron-wf -n argo

Deleting the Argo CRDs and other resources:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl delete -f quick-start-minimal.yaml

Deleting the Argo namespace:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl delete namespace argo
