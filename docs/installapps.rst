Cassandra
=========

The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scale ability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scale ability
and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make
it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple data centers is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.
